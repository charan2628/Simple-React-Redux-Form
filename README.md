# Simple-React-Redux-Form

Simple React Form

This form uses Redux to store the form data in a single state object.
All the update events generated by UI changes the single state object through Redux <a href="https://github.com/charan2628/Simple-React-Redux-Form/blob/master/util/actionCreators.js">actions</a>.
This form uses fetch API to make calls to server Ex: It makes call to server for city names on entered zipCode in UI.

Due to Redux single state the pre-loading of from in UI is simple, by just giving the <a href="https://github.com/charan2628/Simple-React-Redux-Form/blob/master/util/data.js">intial state</a> to Redux Store
